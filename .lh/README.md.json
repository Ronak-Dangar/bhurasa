            "content": "## Groundnut Oil Startup Operating System\n\nThis repository implements a specialised CRM + Manufacturing ERP to run a wood pressed groundnut oil business end-to-end. It combines pipeline orchestration, production batch logging, inventory control, and lightweight accounting into a single responsive Next.js application.\n\n### Stack\n\n- Next.js App Router (TypeScript) deployed on Vercel\n- Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Row Level Security)\n- Tailwind CSS (mobile-first)\n- React Hook Form + Zod for interactive forms\n\n### Features at a Glance\n\n- **Command Center Dashboard**: Live pipeline alerts (nurture, retention, inventory, delivery). Quick-action panel and production timeline.\n- **Inventory Management**: Single source of truth for raw material, intermediates, packaging, finished goods, and by-products with low-stock signals.\n- **Production Workflow**: Guided three-phase manufacturing form (de-husking → pressing → bottling) with computed yields and batch summary.\n- **Order Entry & Delivery View**: Sales desk interface to raise orders plus RBAC-limited delivery agent view exposing only necessary customer data.\n- **Smart CRM Automations**: Automatic refill reminders and feedback nudges tied to customer family size and delivered quantities.\n- **Finance Snapshot**: Income vs expenses with COD receivables context and actionable margin levers.\n- **Supabase Schema**: SQL DDL + seed data, RLS policies for Super Admins and Delivery Agents, and `calculate_next_refill_date` helper.\n\n## Local Development\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nVisit `http://localhost:3000` on any device—layout adapts down to 360px viewports.\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nDuplicate `.env.example` (create one if missing) into `.env.local` and populate with Supabase credentials:\n\n```\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=\nSUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=\n```\n\nThe service role key is required only for local tooling or server actions that manage RLS-enabled resources—never expose it client-side. When deploying on Vercel, configure these variables in the project dashboard.\n\n## Supabase Setup\n\n1. Create or reuse a Supabase project.\n2. Run the SQL in `supabase/schema.sql` using the Supabase SQL Editor or CLI.\n\t- Creates enumerations, tables, triggers, and RLS policies.\n\t- Seeds sample profiles, customers, inventory, orders, and expenses to mirror UI mock data.\n3. In Supabase Auth → Policies, ensure Email sign-in is enabled. Add your founder account to the `profiles` table with `role = 'super_admin'`.\n\n### Authentication & RBAC Notes\n\n- Super Admins (founders) have unrestricted CRUD on operational tables.\n- Delivery Agents see only orders assigned to them and may toggle status to `delivered`.\n- Customer history, inventory costs, and financial ledgers are fully hidden from delivery agents via RLS.\n\n## Project Structure Highlights\n\n- `app/` — route-driven UI (dashboard, inventory, production, orders, delivery, finance)\n- `components/ui/` — lightweight design primitives (metric cards, tables, badges)\n- `components/production/` — multi-step production workflow form\n- `components/orders/` — sales order form with Supabase-ready payload preview\n- `lib/sample-data.ts` — mock dataset powering UI demos without Supabase yet\n- `lib/analytics.ts` — domain logic for alerts, profit summaries, and refill scheduling\n- `supabase/schema.sql` — authoritative schema + seeds + functions\n\n## Data & Sample Content\n\nThe UI currently reads from in-memory sample data to illustrate expected states. After wiring Supabase, replace `lib/sample-data.ts` fetches with real queries (Server Actions or Supabase client helpers in `lib/supabase/`).\n\nKey helper files:\n\n- `lib/supabase/server.ts` — SSR-friendly client (uses Next.js cookies API)\n- `lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser client for client components where needed\n- `lib/analytics.ts` — `buildPipelineAlerts`, `calculate_next_refill_date`, aggregated metrics\n\n## Deployment Checklist\n\n1. Push repo to GitHub.\n2. Create Vercel project → import repo → set environment variables.\n3. Link Supabase project → set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` & `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.\n4. Re-run `supabase/schema.sql` on production database.\n5. Validate RLS policies by testing super admin vs delivery agent sessions.\n6. Trigger `npm run lint` & `npm run build` locally before deploying.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Hook Supabase data fetching into each route (replace sample data).\n- Add background jobs (Supabase Edge Functions or Scheduled Functions) for automated nurture reminders.\n- Integrate WhatsApp/SMS service for alerts triggered from dashboard actions.\n- Extend analytics with yield-per-farmer and batch cost attribution once live data flows.\n"
