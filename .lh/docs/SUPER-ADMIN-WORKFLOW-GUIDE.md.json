This system provides a single, integrated solution to manage your entire groundnut oil operation—from purchasing raw materials to tracking customer relationships and monitoring profitability.\r\n\r\n**The Power of Integration:** Every action you take in one module automatically updates related areas throughout the system. When you complete a production batch, your inventory updates instantly. When you deliver an order, your customer's status changes automatically. This ensures your business data is always accurate and synchronized.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. The Full Business Cycle: Step-by-Step\r\n\r\n### Workflow 1: Procurement (Buying New Stock)\r\n\r\nThis workflow explains how to record purchases of raw materials (groundnuts, packaging materials) and automatically update your inventory.\r\n\r\n#### Log the Expense\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the **Finance** page\r\n2. Click **\"+ Log New Expense\"**\r\n3. Fill in the expense details:\r\n   - **Amount:** Enter the total purchase cost (e.g., ₹80,000)\r\n   - **Category:** Select **\"Purchase Groundnuts\"** or **\"Purchase Packaging\"**\r\n   - **Description:** Add any relevant notes (supplier name, invoice number, etc.)\r\n\r\n#### Update Inventory (The \"Bridge\")\r\n\r\n**Critical Step:** Because this is a **procurement** expense, the form will ask for additional inventory details:\r\n\r\n- **Item:** Select the inventory item you purchased (e.g., \"Groundnuts\")\r\n- **Quantity:** Enter the amount received (e.g., \"1000\" kg)\r\n\r\n#### What Happens When You Submit\r\n\r\nThe system automatically performs **two integrated actions**:\r\n\r\n1. **Records the ₹80,000 expense** in your Finance module\r\n2. **Adds 1,000 kg to your Groundnuts stock** in the Inventory module\r\n\r\n**Bonus:** The system recalculates the **Average Cost** of the item based on your purchase history. This ensures your profit margin calculations are always accurate when you sell finished products.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Workflow 2: Production (Making Bulk Oil)\r\n\r\nThis workflow explains how to use the Production Kanban board to transform groundnuts into bulk oil through a two-phase manufacturing process.\r\n\r\n#### Start a New Batch\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the **Production** page\r\n2. Click **\"Start New Batch\"**\r\n3. Enter a unique **Batch Code** (e.g., \"BATCH-001\")\r\n4. Click **\"Create Batch\"**\r\n\r\n**Result:** A new batch card appears in the **\"Phase 1: De-husking\"** column.\r\n\r\n#### Complete Phase 1 (De-husking)\r\n\r\n1. Click on the batch card in the De-husking column\r\n2. Enter the production data:\r\n   - **Input Groundnuts (kg):** Amount of raw groundnuts used\r\n   - **Output Peanuts (kg):** Amount of de-husked peanuts produced\r\n   - **Output Husk (kg):** Byproduct generated\r\n3. Click **\"Save & Advance\"**\r\n\r\n**Automated Result:**\r\n- The batch card **moves to \"Phase 2: Pressing\"** column\r\n- **Inventory updates automatically:**\r\n  - Groundnuts stock **decreases** by the input amount\r\n  - Peanuts stock **increases** by the output amount\r\n  - Husk stock **increases** by the byproduct amount\r\n\r\n#### Complete Phase 2 (Pressing)\r\n\r\n1. Click on the batch card in the Pressing column\r\n2. Enter the production data:\r\n   - **Input Peanuts (kg):** Amount of peanuts used (auto-filled from Phase 1)\r\n   - **Output Oil (L):** Liters of bulk oil produced\r\n   - **Output Oilcake (kg):** Byproduct generated\r\n3. Click **\"Save & Complete Batch\"**\r\n\r\n**Automated Result:**\r\n- The batch card **moves to \"Completed\"** column\r\n- **Inventory updates automatically:**\r\n  - Peanuts stock **decreases** by the input amount\r\n  - Bulk Oil stock **increases** by the output amount\r\n  - Oilcake stock **increases** by the byproduct amount\r\n\r\n**Note:** All inventory changes are logged in the Audit Trail with the batch code for full traceability.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Workflow 3: Packaging (Bottling Your Oil)\r\n\r\nThis workflow explains how to convert bulk oil into finished products ready for sale.\r\n\r\n#### Start a Bottling Run\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the **Bottling** page\r\n2. Check the **\"Available Bulk Oil\"** display at the top (e.g., \"500.5 L\")\r\n   - This shows your current bulk oil stock in real-time\r\n\r\n#### Plan Your Run\r\n\r\nUse the bottling form to plan which products to create. You can **mix and match multiple SKUs** in a single run.\r\n\r\n**Example Plan:**\r\n- **Line 1:** 1L Bottle - Quantity: 50 units\r\n- **Line 2:** 5L Tin - Quantity: 10 units\r\n\r\n**How to Add Lines:**\r\n1. Select a **SKU** from the dropdown (e.g., \"1L Bottle\")\r\n2. Enter the **Quantity** (e.g., 50)\r\n3. Click **\"+ Add SKU\"** to add another line\r\n4. Repeat for all products you want to bottle\r\n\r\n#### Execute the Run\r\n\r\n1. Review your bottling plan\r\n2. Click **\"Start Bottling Run\"**\r\n\r\n**Automated Result:** The system performs a **complete multi-inventory transaction**. Using the example above:\r\n\r\n**Decreases (Consumed):**\r\n- Bulk Oil: **-100 L** (50×1L + 10×5L)\r\n- Empty 1L Bottle: **-50 units**\r\n- Empty 5L Tin: **-10 units**\r\n\r\n**Increases (Produced):**\r\n- Finished 1L Oil: **+50 units**\r\n- Finished 5L Oil: **+10 units**\r\n\r\n**Note:** The entire bottling run is logged as a single transaction in the Audit Trail with a unique Bottling Run ID for complete traceability.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Workflow 4: Sales & CRM (Managing Customers)\r\n\r\nThis workflow explains how to manage customer relationships from initial inquiry through repeat purchases.\r\n\r\n#### Manage Leads\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the **Customers** page\r\n2. Click **\"Add New Customer\"** to log a new lead\r\n3. Fill in the customer details:\r\n   - Name, contact information, location\r\n   - **Default Status:** Automatically set to \"Inquiry\"\r\n\r\n#### Track the Sales Pipeline\r\n\r\nAs you nurture each lead, update their status to reflect your sales process:\r\n\r\n1. Click on the customer's name to open their details\r\n2. Go to the **\"Details\"** tab\r\n3. Update their **Status** manually:\r\n   - **Inquiry** → Initial contact made\r\n   - **Price Sent** → Quotation provided\r\n   - **Trust Process** → Building relationship\r\n   - **Converted** → First sale completed\r\n   - **Feedback Pending** → Order delivered, awaiting feedback\r\n   - **Repeat Customer** → Multiple purchases completed\r\n\r\n#### Create an Order\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to **\"New Order\"**\r\n2. Select the **customer** from the dropdown (or create a new one)\r\n3. Add **products** from your finished inventory:\r\n   - Select item (e.g., \"Finished 1L Oil\")\r\n   - Enter quantity\r\n   - Price auto-fills based on your pricing\r\n4. Review the order total\r\n5. Click **\"Submit Order\"**\r\n\r\n**Result:** Order is created with status \"Pending\"\r\n\r\n#### Fulfill an Order\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the **Delivery** board\r\n2. Find the order in the delivery queue\r\n3. When the order is dispatched and delivered, mark it as **\"Delivered\"**\r\n\r\n**Automated Result:**\r\n- Customer's CRM status automatically updates to **\"Feedback Pending\"**\r\n- System calculates the customer's **Next Refill Date** based on their order\r\n- This automatically puts the customer on your radar for a timely follow-up call\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Workflow 5: Full System Oversight\r\n\r\nThis section explains how to monitor your entire business at a glance and access detailed historical data.\r\n\r\n#### The Command Center (Dashboard)\r\n\r\nNavigate to the main **Dashboard** page for a comprehensive view of your business:\r\n\r\n**What You'll See:**\r\n- **Leads to Nurture:** Customers in \"Inquiry\" or \"Price Sent\" stages\r\n- **Orders in Flight:** Pending and in-progress orders\r\n- **Upcoming Refills:** Customers approaching their next purchase date\r\n- **Production Status:** Active batches and their current phase\r\n- **Inventory Alerts:** Low stock warnings for critical items\r\n- **Financial Snapshot:** Quick view of income vs. expenses\r\n\r\n**Use Case:** Start each day by reviewing the Dashboard to prioritize your tasks—follow up with hot leads, complete pending production batches, or restock low-inventory items.\r\n\r\n#### The Finance Hub\r\n\r\nNavigate to the **Finance** page to track your business profitability:\r\n\r\n**Financial Overview:**\r\n- **Total Income:** Revenue from all delivered orders\r\n- **Total Expenses:** All logged expenses (procurement, operations, overhead)\r\n- **Net Profit:** Real-time calculation of Income minus Expenses\r\n\r\n**Additional Features:**\r\n- **Expense Breakdown:** View expenses by category\r\n- **Loan Management:** Track loans, payables, and repayment schedules\r\n- **Cost Analysis:** Monitor your procurement costs and production efficiency\r\n\r\n**Use Case:** Review this page weekly or monthly to understand your business profitability and make informed decisions about pricing, procurement, and investment.\r\n\r\n#### The Audit Trail (Full History)\r\n\r\nIf you ever wonder **\"Why did my stock level change?\"** or **\"When did this inventory move?\"**, the Audit Trail provides complete transparency.\r\n\r\n**How to Access:**\r\n\r\n1.
