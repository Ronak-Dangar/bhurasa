            "content": "# Groundnut Oil Startup OS — Implementation Plan\r\n\r\n## Scope Overview\r\n- Build admin-focused CRM + manufacturing ERP with supporting delivery interface.\r\n- Use Next.js App Router (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, and Supabase client helpers.\r\n- Provide Supabase SQL schema with RLS, seed data, and helper functions.\r\n\r\n## Work Breakdown\r\n1. **Infrastructure & Utilities**\r\n   - Configure global layout, navigation shell, and responsive grid.\r\n   - Set up Supabase client helpers (`lib/supabase/server.ts`, `lib/supabase/client.ts`).\r\n   - Provide shared UI primitives (cards, badges, table, alert chips).\r\n\r\n2. **Sample Data & Types**\r\n   - Define TypeScript domain models in `types/`.\r\n   - Provide `lib/sample-data.ts` with mock records for dashboard demos (inventory, customers, orders, production).\r\n   - Implement derived helper functions for alerts (nurture, retention, low stock).\r\n\r\n3. **Dashboard Command Center**\r\n   - Create `/app/page.tsx` as admin dashboard showing:\r\n     - Key production & financial metrics summary cards.\r\n     - Pipeline alert widgets (nurture + retention + low stock + delivery follow-ups).\r\n     - Tables/lists for active leads and upcoming refills.\r\n\r\n4. **Inventory Module**\r\n   - Build `/app/inventory/page.tsx` to list items, highlight low-stock, and show consumption trends (static sample data).\r\n\r\n5. **Production Run Workflow**\r\n   - Implement `/app/production/page.tsx` as multi-step form (de-husking → pressing → bottling) with stateful client component, updating preview summary.\r\n   - Hook into helper functions to compute expected outputs and create inventory adjustments (conceptual placeholders).\r\n\r\n6. **Order Management**\r\n   - Create `/app/orders/new/page.tsx` for order entry (customer select, products, payment, assignment) with sample data bridging to inventory.\r\n   - Provide delivery agent list view `/app/delivery/page.tsx` that uses RBAC stub to filter assigned orders.\r\n\r\n7. **Accounting Snapshot**\r\n   - Add `/app/finance/page.tsx` summarizing income, expenses, actionable profit metrics using sample data.\r\n\r\n8. **Styling & Components**\r\n   - Ensure responsive design with Tailwind; include mobile navigation (bottom sheet) and desktop sidebar.\r\n   - Add charts using lightweight CSS-only or simple components (no heavy chart libs to keep deps minimal).\r\n\r\n9. **Documentation & Schema**\r\n   - Write Supabase schema + seeds in `supabase/schema.sql` covering:\r\n     - Tables for customers, inventory, orders, production, expenses, assignments, status history.\r\n     - RLS policies for super_admin vs delivery_agent.\r\n     - `calculate_next_refill_date` function + triggers.\r\n     - Sample insert statements.\r\n   - Update `README.md` with setup steps, environment variables, and workflow explanation.\r\n\r\n## Out of Scope / Assumptions\r\n- Supabase project provisioning and env var secrets handled externally.\r\n- Real-time updates and background jobs noted as future enhancements.\r\n- Authentication scaffolding limited to Supabase helper placeholders.\r\n"
