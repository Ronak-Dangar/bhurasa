For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->\r\n- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.\r\n\tSummary: Created the instructions file with the provided checklist.\r\n\r\n- [x] Clarify Project Requirements\r\n\tSummary: Confirmed stack and module scope from user brief (Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind, Vercel).\r\n\t<!-- Ask for project type, language, and frameworks if not specified. Skip if already provided. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Scaffold the Project\r\n\tSummary: Ran create-next-app for App Router TypeScript + Tailwind scaffold in project root.\r\n\t<!--\r\n\tEnsure that the previous step has been marked as completed.\r\n\tCall project setup tool with projectType parameter.\r\n\tRun scaffolding command to create project files and folders.\r\n\tUse '.' as the working directory.\r\n\tIf no appropriate projectType is available, search documentation using available tools.\r\n\tOtherwise, create the project structure manually using available file creation tools.\r\n\t-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Customize the Project\r\n\tSummary: Implemented dashboard, inventory, production, orders, delivery, finance modules with Supabase schema.\r\n\t<!--\r\n\tVerify that all previous steps have been completed successfully and you have marked the step as completed.\r\n\tDevelop a plan to modify codebase according to user requirements.\r\n\tApply modifications using appropriate tools and user-provided references.\r\n\tSkip this step for \"Hello World\" projects.\r\n\t-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Install Required Extensions\r\n\tSummary: No additional VS Code extensions required beyond defaults.\r\n\t<!-- ONLY install extensions provided mentioned in the get_project_setup_info. Skip this step otherwise and mark as completed. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Compile the Project\r\n\tSummary: Installed dependencies and ran npm run lint && npm run build (passes).\r\n\t<!--\r\n\tVerify that all previous steps have been completed.\r\n\tInstall any missing dependencies.\r\n\tRun diagnostics and resolve any issues.\r\n\tCheck for markdown files in project folder for relevant instructions on how to do this.\r\n\t-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create and Run Task\r\n\t<!--\r\n\tVerify that all previous steps have been completed.\r\n\tCheck https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks to determine if the project needs a task. If so, use the create_and_run_task to create and launch a task based on package.json, README.md, and project structure.\r\n\tSkip this step otherwise.\r\n\t -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Launch the Project\r\n\t<!--\r\n\tVerify that all previous steps have been completed.\r\n\tPrompt user for debug mode, launch only if confirmed.\r\n\t -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete\r\n\t<!--\r\n\tVerify that all previous steps have been completed.\r\n\tVerify that README.md and the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists and contains current project information.\r\n\tClean up the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory by removing all HTML comments.\r\n\t -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n## Execution Guidelines\r\nPROGRESS TRACKING:\r\n- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.\r\n- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.\r\n- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION RULES:\r\n- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.\r\n- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. \"No extensions needed\").\r\n- Do not explain project structure unless asked.\r\n- Keep explanations concise and focused.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT RULES:\r\n- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.\r\n- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.\r\n- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.\r\n- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.\r\n- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Code—do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.\r\n- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.\r\n\r\nFOLDER CREATION RULES:\r\n- Always use the current directory as the project root.\r\n- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.\r\n- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.\r\n- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode.\r\n\r\nEXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:\r\n- Only install extension specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. DO NOT INSTALL any other extensions.\r\n\r\nPROJECT CONTENT RULES:\r\n- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a \"Hello World\" project as a starting point.\r\n- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.\r\n- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.\r\n- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.\r\n- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.\r\n- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.\r\n- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.\r\n\r\nTASK COMPLETION RULES:\r\n- Your task is complete when:\r\n  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors\r\n  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project\r\n  - README.md file exists and is up to date\r\n  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project\r\n\r\nBefore starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.\r\n-->\r\n- Work through each checklist item systematically.\r\n- Keep communication concise and focused.\r\n- Follow development best practices.\r\n"
